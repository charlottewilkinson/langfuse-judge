## Features

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) App Router
  - Advanced routing for seamless navigation and performance
  - React Server Components (RSCs) and Server Actions for server-side rendering and increased performance
- [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs)
  - Unified API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs
  - Hooks for building dynamic chat and generative user interfaces
  - Supports Google (default), OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and other model providers
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
  - Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - Component primitives from [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) for accessibility and flexibility
- Data Persistence
  - [Vercel Postgres powered by Neon](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres) for saving chat history and user data
  - [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/storage/blob) for efficient object storage
- [NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth)
  - Simple and secure authentication
- **Dynamic forms** – Ask the chatbot to generate a form (e.g. with specific fields); it will render a fillable form in the chat. Submitting sends the values back to the conversation.
- **Real-Time Web Search**
  - Integrated with [Tavily API](https://tavily.com/) to grant the chatbot internet access for up-to-date answers and research.

## Dynamic form example prompts

Try these in the chat to see dynamically generated forms:

- *"Give me a form with 4 inputs: name, email, age, and comments, with a submit button."*
- *"Create a form with fields for first name, last name, and email. Use 'Send' as the button text."*
- *"I need a simple contact form with name, email, and message."*
- *"Make a form with 3 text boxes: title above each, and a submit button at the bottom."*
- *"Generate a feedback form with rating (number), comment (text), and email."*
- *"I want a form with an email input at the top, a larger content/message box below it, and a Send button."*

Field type `textarea` renders a bigger, resizable box (e.g. for messages or comments). After you submit a form, the values are sent as a message so the assistant can respond.

## Model Providers

This template ships with Google Gemini `gemini-1.5-pro` models as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various Google Cloud and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Set Up Environment Variables
To enable web search capabilities, you will also need a Tavily API key:

1. Get your API key from [Tavily](https://www.tavily.com).
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   TAVILY_API_KEY='tvly-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
